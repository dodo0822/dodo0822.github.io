          <h2>Light Dance Show</h2>
          <p>For the annual student performance our team developed a programmable light dance platform. The platform includes a file format for specifying what should be turned on at what time, a simulator to preview the lighting effects and a device controlling the light. The simulator is implemented using HTML5 canvas. The device includes a MediaTek MT7688 SoC, a PCA9685 PWM driver which drives transistors that in turn powers the electroluminescence wires.</p>
          <p>The software on the device is programmed using C++. It conducts time synchronization, reads the instructions and gives command based on the time code.</p>

          <h2>University Campus Hide and Seek</h2>
          <p>The game is designed for high school students to discover the department by interacting with RFID sensors hidden throughout the campus. The device is implemented using Espressif ESP8266 module and RC522 RFID reader module. I have also designed and fabricated custom PCBs.</p>
          <p>The game server is developed using Node.js and MongoDB. To make the devices able to send game data back to the server, we connect the devices to the campus wireless access points and use DNS tunneling technique to transport the data.</p>

          <h2>Garbage Disposal in Taipei</h2>
          <p>In this project our team, which consisted of Electrical Engineering and Industrial Design students, researched on possible improvements of the garbage disposal system in Taipei. We designed an autonomous garbage collection vehicle (AGC) and a companion mobile application. The user can request an AGC to come to pickup their waste, and the AGC has a algorithm to calculate the best route basing on user demand. Furthermore, we implemented a container prototype that identifies type of waste using convolutional neural network.</p>

          <h2>DoorFriend</h2>
          <p>Our team designed a door lock that is able to recognize the person in front of the door by the person's face and voice. The detection and recognition algorithm are implented on a Raspberry Pi 3 development board, and the lock is controlled by an Arduino board. I worked on integrating the algorithm with the hardware, door lock firmware programming and the final product assembly.</p>

          <h2>Fridge Temperature Monitor</h2>
          <p>My course project for the logic design course is a temperature monitor implemented on a Basys 3 FPGA board. The user is able to set a desired temperature and the device gives warning if the reading is over the threshold. The temperature is being read from a DHT11 sensor using one-wire communication, and the system status is shown on a monitor using VGA signal. User interact with the system by the flipping switches on the board.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Poker</h2>
          <p>Our team developed a web based Chinese poker online game. The user is able to join a room and play against each other. AI players are also implemented to fill empty player slots. The game server is developed using C++ using Boost library and client is implemented with JavaScript and Phaser library.</p>
